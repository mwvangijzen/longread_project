# Long-read RNA sequencing data processing workflow in comparison with short-read RNA sequencing analysis

In this project, a neuroblastoma dataset was used to set up a long-read data processing workflow based on the Epi2me transcriptomes workflow. To assess advantages and limitations of long-read data analysis steps, a short-read neuroblastoma dataset and data processing workflow were used in comparison.
